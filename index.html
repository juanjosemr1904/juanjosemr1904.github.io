<h2>About FC Barcelona</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.es/es/ ">FC Barcelona</a>, founded in 1899, is one of the most iconic and successful football clubs in the world. Known for its unique playing style, rich history, and passionate supporters, the club represents much more than football — it symbolizes Catalan culture and identity.
</p>

<h2>Players</h2>
<p>
Many players have come and gone at Barça. I was born in 2006, so I remember players like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/carles5puyol/"> Puyol</a>,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/xavi/"> Xavi</a>,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/andresiniesta8/"> Iniesta</a>, <a href=" https://www.instagram.com/davidvilla/"> Villa</a>, and many others who had spectacular performances at Barcelona. But there's one player I admire every day, and that's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/leomessi/"> Lionel Messi</a>. That little boy who left Rosario, Argentina, at a very young age to fulfill his dreams was Barça's best player for over 10 years, and for me, the best player in the world because of all the skills he possesses and how he applies them on the field. You can't talk about Barça without thinking of "La Pulga" (The Flea).

<h2>FC BARCELONA's official ANTHEM"Cant del Barca"</h2>
<p>The ‘Cant del Barça’, composed in 1974, is the current anthem of the Club. It was written to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the club by writers Josep M. Espinàs and Jaume Picas, with music by Manuel Valls, and is still very much in use today.</p>

<h2>L'ESCUT AL PIT  FC BARCELONA's 125th ANNIVERSARY ANTHEM</h2>
<p>FC Barcelona's 125th Anniversary has its Official Song. The club members have had their say, and the song they have gone for is L’escut al pit, which is available on Spotify, with lyrics by Xavier Gonzàlez-Costa, music by Carles Cases, and performed by the Orfeó Català and Dracs 1991.

</p>
<p> The outcome of the three-week voting process was announced at Friday's 125th Anniversary Gala at the Gran Teatre del Liceu, where all three candidate tunes were performed live. There will be a repeat performance of the winning entry tomorrow Saturday at the Estadi Olímpic in the build-up to the Liga game with UD Las Palmas.</p>
